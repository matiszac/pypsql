### pypsql
*A structured query builder with fluent syntax for Pervasive SQL.*

> pypsql is a python package that provides a fluent, object-oriented API for defining and composing SQL
> queries against Pervasive SQL databases. It uses explicitly defined table and column structures to offer
> type-safety, autocompletion, and better query maintainability compared to raw SQL strings.


### Why?
- I am currently building an api interface into an old pervasive sql backend with `FastAPI` and `pyodbc`.
- Pervasive SQL is very limited compared to other flavors of SQL and this is not directly supported by python ORM's I've come accross.
- I just needed a simply library to model the database and easily build sql queries.

### What can it do?
- Currently not too much as this is a VERY early prototype developed within a few hours to make the `Boot.dev July 2025 Hackathon` submission deadline.
